EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, AND MARKETS MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES, PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AND PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS, AND SELLS A VARIETY OF RELATED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PERIPHERALS, NETWORKING SOLUTIONS, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE IPHONE, IPAD, MAC, IPOD, APPLE TV, A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, THE IOS AND OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS, ICLOUD, AND A VARIETY OF ACCESSORY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS AND DELIVERS DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, IBOOKSTORE, AND MAC APP STORE. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES, AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, AS WELL AS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF THIRD-PARTY IPHONE, IPAD, MAC AND IPOD COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND VARIOUS ACCESSORIES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO CONSUMERS; SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES; AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO BRINGING THE BEST USER EXPERIENCE TO ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS INNOVATIVE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICES. THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS STRATEGY LEVERAGES ITS UNIQUE ABILITY TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP ITS OWN OPERATING SYSTEMS, HARDWARE, APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE ITS CUSTOMERS NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS WITH SUPERIOR EASE-OF-USE, SEAMLESS INTEGRATION, AND INNOVATIVE DESIGN. AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS PLATFORM FOR THE DISCOVERY AND DELIVERY OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. AS PART OF THE ITUNES STORE, THE COMPANY\\x92S APP STORE AND IBOOKSTORE ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO DISCOVER AND DOWNLOAD APPLICATIONS AND BOOKS THROUGH EITHER A MAC OR WINDOWS-BASED COMPUTER OR THROUGH \\x93IOS DEVICES,\\x94 NAMELY IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH. THE COMPANY\\x92S MAC APP STORE ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO EASILY DISCOVER, DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL MAC APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO SUPPORTS A COMMUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND DIGITAL CONTENT THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\\x92S OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY\\x92S STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDES EXPANDING ITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK TO EFFECTIVELY REACH MORE CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND POST-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE.  THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, INCLUDING THE MARKET FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICES WITH ITS IOS DEVICES; PERSONAL COMPUTERS WITH ITS MAC COMPUTERS; PORTABLE DIGITAL PLAYERS WITH IPOD; AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS WITH THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, IBOOKSTORE, AND MAC APP STORE. WHILE THE COMPANY IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A LEADING INNOVATOR IN     25       TABLE OF      THE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES, THESE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE PRICING. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING IS CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY\\x92S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON INVESTING IN NEW HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND IN FURTHER DEVELOPING ITS EXISTING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPHONE, IPAD, MAC, AND IPOD HARDWARE; IOS AND OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS; AND A VARIETY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND ONLINE SERVICES.  THE COMPANY USES A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, SUCH AS ITS RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES, AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, AND THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS WHO CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INTEGRATION, AND DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES PROVIDING DIRECT CONTACT WITH ITS TARGETED CUSTOMERS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF ITS PRODUCTS OVER THOSE OF ITS COMPETITORS AND PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING NEW AND RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY BUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH SERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE ITS DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES BY EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF ITS OWN RETAIL STORES WORLDWIDE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES BY PLACING HIGH QUALITY APPLE FIXTURES, MERCHANDISING MATERIALS AND OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN SELECTED THIRD-PARTY RESELLER LOCATIONS. THROUGH THE APPLE PREMIUM RESELLER PROGRAM, CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS FOCUS ON THE APPLE PLATFORM BY PROVIDING A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEGRATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AND PRODUCT EXPERTISE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\\x93GAAP\\x94) AND THE COMPANY\\x92S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY\\x92S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, \\x93SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\x94 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ',\n",
       "  '8OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\\x92S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\\x92S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\\x92S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANY\\x92S SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS,     26       TABLE OF      SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.  FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\\x92S FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\\x92S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\\x93VSOE\\x94), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (\\x93TPE\\x94) AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (\\x93ESP\\x94). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANY\\x92S BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.  FOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\\x92S ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY\\x92S ESPS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS.  THE COMPANY\\x92S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENT\\x92S JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. IF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERLYING THE FACTORS CONSIDERED CHANGE, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES OR THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED, OR SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD THE COMPANY TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS, THE COMPANY\\x92S ESPS AND THE FUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE.  THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. THE COMPANY\\x92S POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANY\\x92S OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\\x92S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENT\\x92S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\\x92S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES  THE COMPANY\\x92S INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET     27      TABLE OF      OF TAX, IN THE COMPANY\\x92S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANY\\x92S NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITY\\x92S COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST; THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO; AND THE COMPANY\\x92S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANY\\x92S ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY.  INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.  THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY\\x92S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.  WARRANTY COSTS  THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\\x92S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A     28      TABLE OF      VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\\x92S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\\x92S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES  AS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ',\n",
       "  '3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \\x93LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\x94 AND IN PART II, ',\n",
       "  '8OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 7 \\x93COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,\\x94 THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENT\\x92S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY\\x92S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  FISCAL PERIOD  THE COMPANY\\x92S FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANY\\x92S FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF IPAD UNIT SALES WAS HIGHER THAN THE GROWTH RATE OF IPAD NET SALES DURING 2012 DUE TO A REDUCTION OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD LOWER-PRICED IPAD MODELS, THE PRICE REDUCTION FOR IPAD 2 AND AN INCREASE IN INDIRECT SALES DUE TO EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS. NET SALES OF IPAD AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE 21% AND 19% OF THE COMPANY\\x92S TOTAL NET SALES FOR 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.        \\x95    MAC NET SALES WERE $23.2 BILLION IN 2012, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $1.4 BILLION OR 7 COMPARED TO 2011.

THE AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE INCREASED 27 TO     34       TABLE OF      $43.3 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO $34.1 MILLION IN 2010. THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPRESENTED 13% AND 15% OF THE COMPANY\\x92S TOTAL NET SALES IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  THE RETAIL SEGMENT\\x92S OPERATING INCOME WAS $4.7BILLION, $3.2 BILLION, AND $2.3 BILLION DURING 2012, 2011, AND 2010 RESPECTIVELY. THESE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN RETAIL OPERATING INCOME WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER OVERALL NET SALES THAT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE DURING THE RESPECTIVE YEARS.  GROSS MARGIN  GROSS MARGIN FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES):                           2012      2011      2010       NET SALES    $ 156,508      $ 108249       $ 65,225      COST OF SALES      87846         64,431         39,541                                         GROSS MARGIN    $ 68662       $ 43,818      $ 25,684                                         GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE      43.9%         40.5%         39.4%     THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2012 WAS 43.9%, COMPARED TO 40.5% IN 2011. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMMODITY AND OTHER PRODUCT COSTS, A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE SALES, AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 WAS 45.9% COMPARED TO 41.4% DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2012. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF HIGHER GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2012 COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF ARE A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE SALES AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER NET SALES. ADDITIONALLY, GROSS MARGIN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2012 WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH FLAT PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, PRICE REDUCTIONS ON CERTAIN EXISTING PRODUCTS, HIGHER TRANSITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMMODITY COSTS.  THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2011 WAS 40.5%, COMPARED TO 39.4% IN 2010. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMMODITY AND OTHER PRODUCT COSTS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING 2012, AND THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES GROSS MARGIN OF ABOUT 36% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. EXPECTED FUTURE DECLINES IN GROSS MARGIN ARE LARGELY DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WITH FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS AND ANTICIPATED COMPONENT COST AND OTHER COST INCREASES. FUTURE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR COULD FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGIN.  THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY\\x92S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE IN PART I, ',\n",
       "  '1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \\x93RISK FACTORS\\x94 AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANY\\x92S SALES MIX TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY\\x92S ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANY\\x92S SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.     35       TABLE OF     OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PERCENTAGES):                           2012      2011      2010       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT    $ 3,381       $ 2,429       $ 1,782      PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES      2%         2%         3%      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE    $ 10,040       $ 7599       $ 5,517     PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES      6%         7         8     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\\x93R&D\\x94) EXPENSE  R&D EXPENSE INCREASED $952 MILLION OR 39% IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 AND $647MILLION OR 36% IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE GROWTH IN R&D EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES. ALTHOUGH TOTAL R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 39% AND 36% IN 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, IT REMAINED FAIRLY CONSISTENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY\\x92S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN R&D TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\x93SG&A\\x94) EXPENSE  SG&A EXPENSE INCREASED $2.4 BILLION OR 32% DURING 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 AND $2.1 BILLION OR 38 DURING 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANY\\x92S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT, INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, HIGHER SPENDING ON PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED VARIABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\\x92S NET SALES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS):                           2012     2011     2010       INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME    $  1,088     $    519      $    311      OTHER EXPENSE, NET      (566 )        (104 )        (156 )                                       TOTAL OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET    $ 522      $ 415      $ 155                                      TOTAL OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASED $107MILLION OR 26% TO $522 MILLION DURING 2012 COMPARED TO $415 MILLION AND $155 MILLION IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE DURING 2012 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME ON THE COMPANY\\x92S HIGHER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME AND NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS 1.03%, 0.77, AND 0.75% DURING 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2012, 2011, AND 2010, THE COMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING AND ACCORDINGLY DID NOT INCUR ANY RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY\\x92S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY 25.2%, 24.2%, AND 24.4% FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY\\x92S EFFECTIVE RATES FOR THESE PERIODS DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF     36       TABLE OF      35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $4.0 BILLION, AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $14.9 BILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (THE \\x93IRS\\x94) HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\\x92S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2006 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS CONTESTED CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2007THROUGH 2009. ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2004 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY\\x92S TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\\x92S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND STATISTICS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2010 (IN MILLIONS):                           2012      2011      2010       CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES    $ 121,251       $ 81,570       $ 51,011      ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET    $ 10,930       $ 5,369       $ 5,510      INVENTORIES    $ 791       $ 776       $ 1,051      WORKING CAPITAL    $ 19,111       $ 17018      $ 20,956      ANNUAL OPERATING CASH FLOW    $ 50,856       $ 37529       $ 18595     AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD $121.3 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AN INCREASE OF $39.7BILLION OR 49% FROM SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THIS NET INCREASE WAS THE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $50.9 BILLION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $83 BILLION, PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $1.1 BILLION AND PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS OF $2.5 BILLION.  THE COMPANY\\x92S MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED PRIMARILY IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, $82.6 BILLION AND $54.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY\\x92S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CAPITAL ASSETS  THE COMPANY\\x92S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $10.3 BILLION DURING 2012, CONSISTING OF $865 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND $9.5 BILLION FOR OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS     37      TABLE OF      EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE COMPANY\\x92S ACTUAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2012 WERE $83 BILLION.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES UTILIZING APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2013, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND APPROXIMATELY $9.15 BILLION FOR OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, AND CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND ENHANCEMENTS.  DURING 2013, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO OPEN ABOUT 30 TO 35 NEW RETAIL STORES, WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.  DIVIDEND AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  IN MARCH 2012, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED A DIVIDEND POLICY PURSUANT TO WHICH IT PLANS TO PAY, SUBJECT TO SUBSEQUENT DECLARATION, QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF $2.65 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION EACH QUARTER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE QUARTERLY DECLARED DIVIDENDS.  IN MARCH 2012, THE COMPANY\\x92S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $10 BILLION OF THE COMPANY\\x92S COMMON STOCK BEGINNING IN 2013. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE EXECUTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF NEUTRALIZING THE IMPACT OF DILUTION FROM FUTURE EMPLOYEE EQUITY GRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $45 BILLION OF DOMESTIC CASH TO PAY DIVIDENDS, REPURCHASE SHARES, AND TO REMIT WITHHELD TAXES RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE DIVIDEND AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE CASH USED FOR FUTURE DIVIDENDS AND THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL COME PRIMARILY FROM CURRENT DOMESTIC CASH AND FROM ON-GOING U.S. OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE CASH GENERATED FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, OR OTHER CONTINGENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL CONTINUING RISKS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION UNDER A VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK, OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE COMPANY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN PAYMENTS DUE BY THE COMPANY UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH MINIMUM FIRM COMMITMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND EXCLUDES AMOUNTS ALREADY RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (IN MILLIONS):                                       TOTAL          PAYMENTSDUE  INLESSTHAN1 YEAR      PAYMENTSDUE IN1-3 YEARS      PAYMENTSDUE IN4-5 YEARS      PAYMENTSDUE  INMORETHAN5 YEARS       OPERATING LEASES    $ 4,414       $ 516       $ 1,098      $ 999       $ 1,801      PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS      21,053         21,053         0         0         0      OTHER OBLIGATIONS      988        937        49         2         0                                                               TOTAL    $ 26,455       $ 22,506       $ 1,147      $ 1,001       $ 1,801                                                              LEASE COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY\\x92S MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE TYPICALLY FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS. LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS RANGING FROM     38      TABLE OF      FIVE TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS, AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY\\x92S TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $4.4 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.1 BILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.  PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUTSOURCING PARTNERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS  THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL OUTSOURCING PARTNERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF $21.1 BILLION.  OTHER OBLIGATIONS  IN ADDITION TO THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OF $988MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THAT WERE COMPRISED MAINLY OF COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, AND COMMITMENTS RELATED TO ADVERTISING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY\\x92S OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE RELATED GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD NON-CURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $13.8BILLION. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $2.1 BILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL $401 MILLION FOR GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TAX LIABILITIES; THEREFORE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.  INDEMNIFICATION  THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 OR SEPTEMBER 24, 2011.  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.     39       TABLE OF       ',\n",
       "  '7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT  THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES. GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANY\\x92S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THESE POSITIONS WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. FURTHER, THE RECOGNITION TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THESE INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\\x92S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  INTEREST RATE RISK  WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLD\\x92S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY\\x92S INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN U.S. INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANY\\x92S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGING.  THE COMPANY\\x92S INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY ARE FOCUSED ON PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL AND SUPPORTING THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY. A PORTION OF THE COMPANY\\x92S CASH IS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES OF THE COMPANY\\x92S INVESTMENT POLICY AND TO OBJECTIVE MARKET BENCHMARKS. THE COMPANY\\x92S INTERNAL PORTFOLIO IS BENCHMARKED AGAINST EXTERNAL MANAGER PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY\\x92S EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY\\x92S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES, AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE, WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS.  TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\\x92S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $2.1 BILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD RESULT IN A $913 MILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY.  FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK  IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\\x92S NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY\\x92S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES, TYPICALLY FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS AND THE PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES.     40       TABLE OF     TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\\x92S FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (\\x93VAR\\x94) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE THOUSANDS OF RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANY\\x92S FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $200 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $161 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, THE LOSS IN FAIR VALUE INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\\x93GAAP\\x94) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR\\x92S PRESENTATION. PRIOR PERIOD COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\\x92S HIGH-PROFILE RETAIL STORES HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PERIOD\\x92S PRESENTATION. REFER TO NOTE 8 \\x93SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\\x94 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  THE COMPANY\\x92S FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANY\\x92S FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. AN ADDITIONAL WEEK IS INCLUDED IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS TO REALIGN FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS. FISCAL YEAR 2012 SPANNED 53 WEEKS, WITH A 14TH WEEK INCLUDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010 SPANNED 52 WEEKS EACH. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, REFERENCES TO PARTICULAR YEARS OR QUARTERS REFER TO THE COMPANY\\x92S FISCAL YEARS ENDED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE ASSOCIATED QUARTERS OF THOSE FISCAL YEARS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.  FOR THE SALE OF MOST THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK FOR PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS     47      TABLE OF      CUSTOMERS. FOR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS SOLD THROUGH THE APP STORE AND MAC APP STORE AND CERTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS AND IS NOT THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR SUCH SALES ON A NET BASIS BY RECOGNIZING IN NET SALES ONLY THE COMMISSION IT RETAINS FROM EACH SALE. THE PORTION OF THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO CUSTOMERS THAT IS REMITTED BY THE COMPANY TO THIRD-PARTY APP DEVELOPERS AND CERTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT OWNERS IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\\x92S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE WHEN IT RECEIVES PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED FOR UNSPECIFIED AND SPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SELLS GIFT CARDS REDEEMABLE AT ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, AND ALSO SELLS GIFT CARDS REDEEMABLE ON THE ITUNES STORE FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE. THE COMPANY RECORDS DEFERRED REVENUE UPON THE SALE OF THE CARD, WHICH IS RELIEVED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE CARD BY THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM APPLECARE SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. APPLECARE SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS OFFERED UNDER THE COMPANY\\x92S STANDARD LIMITED WARRANTY.  THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED. FOR THE COMPANY\\x92S OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\\x92S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. REVENUE IS RECORDED NET OF TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WITH THE COLLECTED TAXES RECORDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES UNTIL REMITTED TO THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.  REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES  FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\\x92S FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCT\\x92S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\\x93VSOE\\x94), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (\\x93TPE\\x94), AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (\\x93ESP\\x94). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANY\\x92S BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THE VSOE OF EACH ELEMENT, AND IF VSOE DOES NOT EXIST REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN ELEMENTS LACKING VSOE ARE DELIVERED.  FOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH (\\x93IOS DEVICES\\x94), MAC AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES TO THE ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH EACH OF THESE HARDWARE PRODUCTS FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE FOR IOS DEVICES INCLUDES IOS AND RELATED APPLICATIONS AND FOR MAC INCLUDES OS X, RELATED APPLICATIONS AND ILIFE. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED UP TO THREE DELIVERABLES REGULARLY INCLUDED IN ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING THE SALE OF THESE DEVICES. THE FIRST DELIVERABLE IS THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE DEVICE DELIVERED AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE SECOND DELIVERABLE IS THE EMBEDDED RIGHT INCLUDED WITH THE PURCHASE OF IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV TO RECEIVE ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES RELATING TO THE PRODUCT\\x92S ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE. THE THIRD DELIVERABLE IS THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE BETWEEN     48      TABLE OF      THESE DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THESE DELIVERABLES, THE ALLOCATION OF REVENUE IS BASED ON THE COMPANY\\x92S ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED HARDWARE AND THE RELATED ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE PROVIDED THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE EMBEDDED UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS. COST OF SALES RELATED TO DELIVERED HARDWARE AND RELATED ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ESTIMATED WARRANTY COSTS, ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES AS INCURRED, AND ENGINEERING AND SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS OPERATING EXPENSES AS INCURRED.  THE COMPANY\\x92S PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ITS ESP FOR DELIVERABLES WITHOUT VSOE OR TPE CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS CUSTOMERS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO BUY UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS FOR THE ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE INCLUDED WITH ITS QUALIFYING HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THIS VIEW IS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE FACT THAT UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS DO NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE UPGRADES AT A PARTICULAR TIME OR AT ALL, AND DO NOT SPECIFY TO CUSTOMERS WHICH UPGRADES OR FEATURES WILL BE DELIVERED. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES ITS CUSTOMERS WOULD BE UNWILLING TO PAY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FOR ACCESS TO THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BECAUSE OTHER COMPANIES OFFER SIMILAR SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO COST TO USERS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IF IT WERE TO SELL UPGRADE RIGHTS OR ACCESS TO THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ON A STANDALONE BASIS, INCLUDING THOSE RIGHTS AND SERVICES ATTACHED TO IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV, THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE RELATIVELY LOW. KEY FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE COMPANY IN DEVELOPING THE ESPS FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS INCLUDE PRICES CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR SIMILAR OFFERINGS, MARKET TRENDS IN THE PRICING OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY MAC AND IOS COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE, THE NATURE OF THE UPGRADE RIGHTS (E.G., UNSPECIFIED VERSUS SPECIFIED), AND THE RELATIVE ESP OF THE UPGRADE RIGHTS AS COMPARED TO THE TOTAL SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS AS APPROPRIATE, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS, THE PRICING OF COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES IF THEY EXIST, PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, AND THE LENGTH OF TIME A PARTICULAR VERSION OF A DEVICE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE. WHEN RELEVANT, THE SAME FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED BY THE COMPANY IN DEVELOPING ESPS FOR OFFERINGS SUCH AS THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES; HOWEVER, THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IN DEVELOPING ESPS FOR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES IS THE ESTIMATED COST TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION FOR A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN.  FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY\\x92S COMBINED ESPS FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES INCLUDED WITH ITS QUALIFYING HARDWARE DEVICES HAVE RANGED FROM $5 TO $25. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO SUCH RIGHTS INCLUDED WITH IOS DEVICES AND APPLE TV IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER TWO YEARS, AND REVENUE ALLOCATED TO SUCH RIGHTS INCLUDED WITH MAC IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FOUR YEARS.  SHIPPING COSTS  FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS RELATED TO SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE CLASSIFIED AS REVENUE, AND THE COMPANY\\x92S SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.  WARRANTY EXPENSE  THE COMPANY GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PRE-EXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCT\\x92S TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY     49       TABLE OF      HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE EXPENSED AS INCURRED DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010.  ADVERTISING COSTS  ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.0 BILLION, $933 MILLION AND $691 MILLION FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES EXPENSE RELATED TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH IT RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANY OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE\\x92S EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (\\x93RSUS\\x94) IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CLOSING FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST FOR STOCK OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON EACH OPTION\\x92S FAIR-VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON (\\x93BSM\\x94) OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST AS EXPENSE RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS\\x92 EQUITY IF AN INCREMENTAL TAX BENEFIT IS REALIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS, FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 6, \\x93SHAREHOLDERS\\x92 EQUITY AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\\x94 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. SEE NOTE 5, \\x93INCOME TAXES\\x94 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  EARNINGS PER SHARE  BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES HAD BEEN ISSUED. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE COMPANY\\x92S EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND UNVESTED RSUS. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN INCREASE IN     50       TABLE OF      THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE COMPUTATION OF BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT NET INCOME IN MILLIONS AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS):                           2012      2011      2010       NUMERATOR:                     NET INCOME    $ 41,733       $ 25,922       $ 14,013      DENOMINATOR:                     WEIGHTED-AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING      934,818        924,258        909,461      EFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES      10,537        12,387        15,251                                         WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES      945,355         936,645         924,712                                         BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE    $ 44.64       $ 2805       $ 15.41           DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE    $ 44.15       $ 2768      $ 15.15     POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES REPRESENTING 1.0 MILLION, 1.7MILLION AND 1.6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THESE PERIODS BECAUSE THEIR EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTIDILUTIVE.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES  ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANY\\x92S MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES THE DESIGNATIONS AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ITS MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASED ON EACH INSTRUMENT\\x92S UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE. MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ITS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE NATURE OF EACH SECURITY AND ITS AVAILABILITY FOR USE IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY\\x92S MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS\\x92 EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT FAIR VALUE.  FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (\\x93AOCI\\x94) IN SHAREHOLDERS\\x92 EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO INCOME IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, IF ANY, IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT INCOME. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, BOTH THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ',\n",
       "  'ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE COMPANY HAD NO FAIR VALUE     51       TABLE OF      HEDGES IN 2012, 2011 AND 2010. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT INCOME. DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH CURRENT INCOME.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES, CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANY\\x92S CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT CUSTOMERS\\x92 ABILITY TO PAY.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANY\\x92S INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPONENTS AND FINISHED GOODS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH FOR BUILDINGS IS THE LESSER OF 30 YEARS OR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING BUILDING; BETWEEN TWO TO FIVE YEARS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT; AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR TEN YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $2.6 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION AND $815 MILLION DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS, AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT. LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS, AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES, RATHER SUCH ASSETS ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT. IN 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY\\x92S GOODWILL WAS ALLOCATED TO THE AMERICAS AND EUROPE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.     52       TABLE OF     THE COMPANY AMORTIZES ITS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWS THESE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OVER PERIODS TYPICALLY FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  THE COMPANY APPLIES FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS. THE COMPANY DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSACT AND THE MARKET-BASED RISK MEASUREMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, SUCH AS RISKS INHERENT IN VALUATION TECHNIQUES, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND CREDIT RISK. FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BY APPLYING THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE LEVELS AND BASES THE CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS AVAILABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT:  LEVEL 1 \\x96 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 2 \\x96 OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS, OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 3 \\x96 INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENT\\x92S ESTIMATE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  THE COMPANY\\x92S VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND CERTAIN MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE DERIVED FROM QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, ALL OF WHICH HAVE COUNTERPARTIES WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS, WERE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR MODEL DRIVEN VALUATIONS USING SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS, COMPANIES MAY CHOOSE TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ANY ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND REMEASUREMENT  THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD.

THE COMPANY MAY SELL CERTAIN OF ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION AND DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE NET REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED DURING 2012 AND 2011 WERE $183 MILLION AND $110 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND NO SIGNIFICANT NET REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES DURING 2010 RELATED TO SUCH SALES. THE MATURITIES OF THE COMPANY\\x92S LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES GENERALLY RANGE FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES THAT HAD BEEN IN A CONTINUOUS LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR LONGER WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE OF ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY OF ITS INVESTMENTS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES, AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE, WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHEN EVALUATING AN INVESTMENT FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW ITS COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO, AND THE COMPANY\\x92S INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE INVESTMENT\\x92S COST BASIS. DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET SOME OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND COST OF SALES, ON NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  TO HELP PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\\x92S SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE. THE COMPANY\\x92S SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR AND WHO SELL IN LOCAL CURRENCIES MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES\\x92 FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE AND INVENTORY PURCHASES GENERALLY UP TO SIX MONTHS.  TO HELP PROTECT THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE CHANGES IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THESE INVESTMENTS DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS AND THE PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY\\x92S ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI UNTIL THE HEDGED ',\n",
       "  'IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS A PART OF THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET     55       TABLE OF      INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF APPROXIMATELY $240 MILLION AND A NET DEFERRED GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $290 MILLION, NET OF TAXES, RECORDED IN AOCI AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, RESPECTIVELY. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, AND DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\\x92S HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR WITHIN SIX MONTHS.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT TWO-MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN AOCI ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECLASSIFIED IMMEDIATELY INTO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY SIGNIFICANT NET GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010.  THE COMPANY\\x92S UNREALIZED NET GAINS AND LOSSES ON NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT OF AOCI, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GAIN/LOSS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND DO NOT INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE RELATED EXPOSURES, WHICH GENERALLY OFFSET A PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COMPANY\\x92S GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING OR UNSETTLED IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY\\x92S GROSS EXPOSURE ON THESE TRANSACTIONS MAY BE FURTHER MITIGATED BY COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY\\x92S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS A FUNCTION OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY\\x92S FOREIGN EXCHANGE     56       TABLE OF      INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH REDUCE CREDIT RISK BY PERMITTING NET SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. TO FURTHER LIMIT CREDIT RISK, THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE FOR COLLATERAL TO BE RECEIVED OR POSTED WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FLUCTUATES FROM CONTRACTUALLY ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS. THE COMPANY PRESENTS ITS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AT THEIR GROSS FAIR VALUES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY POSTED CASH COLLATERAL RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER ITS COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS OF $278MILLION, WHICH IT RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN MAJOR STATES AND MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, THE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 1989 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, GENERALLY REMAIN OPEN AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT AN ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY\\x92S TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\\x92S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS. ALTHOUGH TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF AUDITS IS NOT CERTAIN, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT TAX AUDIT RESOLUTIONS COULD REDUCE ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY BETWEEN $120 MILLION AND $170 MILLION IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE MAJORITY OF RSUS THAT VESTED IN 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WERE NET-SHARE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE EMPLOYEES\\x92 MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE APPLICABLE INCOME AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD WERE APPROXIMATELY 2.3 MILLION, 1.6 MILLION AND 1.8MILLION FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RSUS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE VESTING DATES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY\\x92S CLOSING STOCK PRICE. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES\\x92 TAX OBLIGATIONS TO TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE $1.2 BILLION, $520 MILLION AND $406 MILLION IN 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THESE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENTS HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY AS THEY REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE VESTING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY.     66       TABLE OF     STOCK OPTION ACTIVITY  A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\x92S STOCK OPTION ACTIVITY AND RELATED INFORMATION FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010, IS AS FOLLOWS:                               OUTSTANDING OPTIONS          NUMBER OFOPTIONS(IN THOUSANDS)     WEIGHTED-AVERAGEEXERCISEPRICE       WEIGHTED-AVERAGEREMAININGCONTRACTUALTERM(IN YEARS)      AGGREGATEINTRINSICVALUE(IN MILLIONS)       BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 26, 2009      34,375      $ 81.17                 OPTIONS GRANTED      34      $ 202.00                  OPTIONS ASSUMED      98     $ 11.99                  OPTIONS CANCELLED      (430 )    $ 136.27                 OPTIONS EXERCISED      (12,352 )    $ 62.69                                                      BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 25, 2010      21,725      $ 90.46                  OPTIONS GRANTED      1      $ 342.62                  OPTIONS CANCELLED      (163 )    $ 12842                  OPTIONS EXERCISED      (9,697)    $ 6763                                                      BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 24, 2011      11,866      $ 10864                  OPTIONS ASSUMED      41      $ 30.86                  OPTIONS CANCELLED      (25 )    $ 103.22                  OPTIONS EXERCISED      (5,337)    $ 84.85                                                      BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012      6,545      $ 12756         1.9       $ 3,531                                    EXERCISABLE AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012      6,505      $ 12803         1.8      $ 3,507     EXPECTED TO VEST AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2012      40      $ 51.07        6.7      $ 24     AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE FISCAL PERIOD IN EXCESS OF THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF OPTIONS OUTSTANDING OR EXERCISABLE. TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS AT TIME OF EXERCISE WAS $2.3 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST FOR RSUS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CLOSING FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN RIGHTS (\\x93STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS\\x94) IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE AND OFFERING DATE, RESPECTIVELY, BASED ON THE FAIR-VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCORPORATES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, ESTIMATED EXPECTED LIFE AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST AS EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.  THE COMPANY DID NOT GRANT ANY STOCK OPTIONS DURING 2012. THE COMPANY GRANTED 1,370 AND 34,000 STOCK OPTIONS DURING 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 7\\x96 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   ACCRUED WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATION  THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANY\\x92S HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\\x92S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PRE-EXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\\x92S ACCRUED WARRANTIES AND RELATED COSTS FOR 2012, 2011, AND 2010 (IN MILLIONS):                           2012     2011     2010       BEGINNING ACCRUED WARRANTY AND RELATED COSTS    $ 1,240      $ 761      $     577     COST OF WARRANTY CLAIMS      (1,786 )      (1,147)      (713 )    ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY      2,184        1,626        897                                      ENDING ACCRUED WARRANTY AND RELATED COSTS    $ 1,638     $ 1,240      $ 761                                      THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF EITHER SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 OR SEPTEMBER 24, 2011.  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH     68      TABLE OF      INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.  CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT  ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, WHICH SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS; HOWEVER THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES THAT CAN MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THESE INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS\\x92 YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. IF THE COMPANY\\x92S SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF AN OUTSOURCING PARTNER DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY\\x92S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY\\x92S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS CONCENTRATED ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY\\x92S REQUIREMENTS.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\\x92S HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURERS FOR MANY OF THE COMPANY\\x92S PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANY\\x92S OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANY\\x92S PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS.  LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS TO SECURE THE SUPPLY OF CERTAIN INVENTORY COMPONENTS. UNDER CERTAIN OF THESE AGREEMENTS, WHICH EXPIRE BETWEEN 2012 AND 2022, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS FOR THE FUTURE PURCHASE OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS AND HAS ACQUIRED CAPITAL EQUIPMENT TO USE IN THE MANUFACTURING OF SUCH COMPONENTS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL OF $4.2 BILLION OF INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS OUTSTANDING, OF WHICH $1.2 BILLION ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND $3.0 BILLION ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL OF $2.3 BILLION OF INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. THE COMPANY\\x92S OUTSTANDING PREPAYMENTS WILL BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN INVENTORY COMPONENT PURCHASES MADE DURING THE TERM OF EACH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY UTILIZED $943 MILLION AND $173 MILLION OF INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS DURING 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.     69       TABLE OF     OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS  LEASE COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY LEASES VARIOUS EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING RETAIL SPACE, UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY UTILIZE ANY OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE TYPICALLY FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS. LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS, AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY\\x92S TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $4.4 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.1 BILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.  RENT EXPENSE UNDER ALL OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH CANCELABLE AND NONCANCELABLE LEASES, WAS $488MILLION, $338MILLION AND $271 MILLION IN 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENT\\x92S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY\\x92S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT.

APPLE INC.\\x92S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT\\x92S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY\\x92S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.  A COMPANY\\x92S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY\\x92S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY\\x92S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.  IN OUR OPINION, APPLE INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.
