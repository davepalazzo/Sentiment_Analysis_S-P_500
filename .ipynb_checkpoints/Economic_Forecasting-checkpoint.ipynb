    "The following analysis explores the predictive capacity of text data extracted from the finanical statements of the most influential companies in the United States on percent change in gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is considered the broadest indicator of economic output and growth and is not only import for investor confidence but is used in the Federal Reserves decision making process for implementing monetary policy for the country. Current indicators used  for economic forecasting in the field of econometrics are vast and include unemployment rate, personal consumption expenditures, business investment, governement spending, inflation, interest rates and net export of goods and services among others. While the field of economietrics has grown in recent years, economists have remained largely unsucessful in consistantly forecasting economic growth rates. \n",
