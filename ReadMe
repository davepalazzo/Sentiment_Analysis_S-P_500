Our goal is to use sentiment analysis on the 10-K fillings of companies in the S&P500 for modeling fluctuations in US annual GDP. 

Libraries/tools  - The following are a list of tools we expect to use through this process:
1.	Python libraries
a.	Numpy
b.	Pandas
c.	Edgar – used to scrape the SEC website for 10-k documents 
d.	Genism
e.	Sklearn

Data Collection details – We will scrape the SEC website for 10-K fillings of companies in the S&P500 utilizing the Edgar package in python to facilitate this process.

Literature Review – Through our review of academic papers we found several using sentiment analysis on various corpora to predict stock prices and company metrics, however we were unable to find papers linking sentiment of public company fillings to economic factors such as GDP. Refer to the following papers, which inspired the project:

1.	Lazy Prices, Lauren Cohen, Christopher J. Malloy, Quoc Nquyen
2.	Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data for Predicting Stock Market Movements, Venkata Sasank Pagolu, Kamal Nayan Reddy, Ganapati Panda, Babita Majhi

Required Work and Timeline – We have divided the necessary work into five phases:

1)	Data collection and cleaning – May 3rd 
2)	Model Evaluation and Selection -  May 10th 
3)	Build Predictive Model and Evaluate – May 17th 
4)	Interpret Model Results and Adjust as necessary – May 24th  
5)	Build User Friendly Interface (AWS) – May 31st
